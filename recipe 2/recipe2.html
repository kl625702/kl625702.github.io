<h1>Angeletti Cookies</h1>

<p>Decorate these crumbly little bites with a light vanilla glaze and <em>colorful</em> sprinkles.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled, plus more for rolling the dough</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>Glaze:
      <ul>
        <li>1⅓ cups confectioners’ sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons multicolor nonpareil sprinkles, for decoration (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <h3>Directions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 375° F.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the butter, granulated sugar, vanilla, and eggs until blended. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until just combined (do not overmix).</li>
    <li>With floured hands, roll level tablespoonfuls of the dough into balls and place on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart. Bake until puffed and the bottoms are pale golden, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Make the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar, 2 tablespoons water, and the vanilla until the mixture forms a thick but pourable glaze (add more water if necessary).</li>
    <li>Dip the top of each cookie into the glaze and let set, rounded side up, on a rack set over a piece of parchment paper. Sprinkle with non-pareils, if using. Allow the glaze to set, about 20 minutes. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.</li>
  </ol>
